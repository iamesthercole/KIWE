# KIWE - Artist Website Project

Esther Cole is a R&B/Soul Artist and founder of the Ministry of Music and Sisterhood Artist Development Bootcamps. 
She is also the founder and host of KIWE Podcasts and Events aimed to bring talented undiscovered artists togther, giving them a platform to be heard and to learn from industry professionals. 
The website was created as a platform for Esther to connect with her audience, showcase her work and collaborate with others. It's a place for people to learn more about her and find all her work in one place.

# UX
### STRATEGY
The goal for this project is to create a platform for the artist Esther Cole to gather and showcase in one place everything that she does relating to her artistry. This not only will make managing content, promotion and communication simpler for Esther but will also help aid engagement and the transfer of information between her and her audience. 

I am creating a website that contains relevant information about Esther, and provides access to all work related to her artistry. The aim is for the website to act as a virtual home to Esther. Like visiting a friend - ideally, here is where you can learn more, feel as if you have spent time with Esther, listen to her music, listen to her podcasts, chat with other fans, buy merchandise, apply to her artist development camps and watch out for updates and shoutouts from Esther. It's a place for Esther to connect with her followers and for followers to connect with her. It's also a place for Esther to tale advantage of to promotion and sales as a business woman.
