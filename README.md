Esther Cole is a R&B/Soul Artist and founder of the Ministry of Music and Sisterhood Artist Development Bootcamps. 
She is also the founder and host of KIWE Podcasts and Events aimed to bring talented undiscovered artists togther, giving them a platform to be heard and to learn from industry professionals. 
The website was created as a platform for Esther to connect with her audience, showcase her work and collaborate with others. It's a place for people to learn more about her and find all her work in one place.

# UX
### STRATEGY
The goal for this project is to create a website platform for the artist Esther Cole to gather and showcase on one platform everything that pertains to her artisty as a singer and music entrepreneur. This not only will make managing content, promotion and communication simpler for Esther but will also help aid engagement and the transfer of information between her and her audience. 

The website must contain relevant information about Esther, and provide access to all work related to her artistry. My aim is for the website to act as a virtual home to Esther. Like visiting a friend - ideally, you will learn more about Esther and feel as if you have spent time with her. You will have access to her music and can follow links to hear more, listen to her podcasts, gain access to her social media accounts, buy merchandise, apply to her artist development camps and subscribe to her mailing list. It's a place for Esther to connect with other artists and industry professionals who are serious about working with her. It's also a place for Esther to take advantage of promotion and sales as a business woman. The website is designed for true fans who appreciate all her projects and content.

#### Pointers:

1. The website will target the artist community, hard followers of her work and attract potential hard followers. It will be desgined for people who buy music, buy tickets, buy merchandise, who will write about her and reach out to her for collaborations. It's not for ordinary fans. 
2. The website will contain the right content for the right users. This audience will want to find the latest information and should be served first. First access to see music, info about what's coming up, opportunities and ways to engage with Esther's work. To buy tickets and merchandise.
3. The website will help increase awareness of Esther's brand, increase sales on all her products and  build more followers. 
4. The website will act as a place to get the latest and will link to everything that she provides on external platforms, which means that website management is minimal and will only need to be updated when there's something new and neccessary. The content will be eye catching, simple and straight to the point.

\About me page, media and pictures

### STRUCTURE
How is the infortmaiton stuctured logically. 
Initially my idea was to have the about me page as the home page, as it fits for an introduction but after careful consideration and research, viewing similiar artist websites, I learned that the landing page is best to be content that will keep the user there. It's best to give them what they're a looking for straight away. This is usually content they can use such as music. This is also beneficial for the artist as it pushes content straight into the users hand and hopefully encourages them to keep listening and purchase. If they want to learn more, then can then decide to by navigating around the website.
